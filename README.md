# Side_Projects
Some side projects that I have been working on
The only one up now is some consulting work I did to compare prices on Amazon for items in Canada and the US.
A second project is one that I completed for a company interview. I was tasked with predicting when people in different age groups would feel comfortable resuming activites post covid.
